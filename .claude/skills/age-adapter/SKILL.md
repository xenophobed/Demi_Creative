"Autumn sunlight filtered through gaps in the leaves, casting dappled shadows on the forest floor. Little Bunny wove through the interplay of light and shadow among the trees. It had been exploring this forest for a whole year now, believing it knew every corner.

Yet today, behind the roots of an ancient oak tree, it discovered something it had never noticed before—a hidden cave. The entrance was half-covered by vines, and from deep within came a mysterious blue glow, as if something was softly calling.

Little Bunny stood at the cave entrance, mixed emotions rising within. Logic told it to be careful, but curiosity burned like a fire in its heart. "Isn't exploring the unknown exactly what I've always pursued?" it thought.

Taking a deep breath, Little Bunny took that crucial step. As it walked deeper, the sight before it took its breath away—the entire cave was like a crystal palace, millions of crystals refracting light, like a galaxy pouring down. In this moment, Little Bunny understood what it meant for "dreams to become reality."

## Adaptation Workflow

### Step 1: Identify Current Content Characteristics

Analyze original content:
```
- Vocabulary complexity
- Sentence length
- Concept abstraction level
- Content length
- Theme type
```

### Step 2: Determine Target Age

Determine adaptation rules based on user-provided `child_age`.

### Step 3: Apply Adaptation Rules

#### Reducing Complexity (e.g., from adult to children's version)

1. **Replace Vocabulary**:
   - Complex words → Simple words
   - Uncommon words → Common words
   - Abstract concepts → Concrete descriptions

2. **Simplify Sentences**:
   - Long sentences → Short sentences
   - Compound sentences → Simple sentences
   - Clauses → Independent sentences

3. **Reduce Length**:
   - Remove non-essential details
   - Keep core plot
   - Condense descriptions

4. **Concretize Concepts**:
   - Abstract → Concrete
   - Use everyday life analogies
   - Add sensory descriptions (see, hear, touch)

#### Increasing Complexity (e.g., from younger to older)

1. **Enrich Vocabulary**:
   - Simple words → Precise words
   - Add adjectives, adverbs
   - Use idioms, proverbs

2. **Complex Sentences**:
   - Merge short sentences
   - Use rhetorical devices
   - Add clauses and correlatives

3. **Expand Content**:
   - Add detailed descriptions
   - Include psychological descriptions
   - Develop plot

4. **Deepen Themes**:
   - Add reflection
   - Explore values
   - Create resonance

### Step 4: Verify Adaptation Results

Check adapted content:
```
✅ Is vocabulary appropriate for target age
✅ Is sentence length within guidelines
✅ Is content length within range
✅ Is core information preserved
✅ Are emotional and educational values maintained
```

## Special Scenario Handling

### Science Knowledge Adaptation

**Original**:
"Photosynthesis is the process by which plants use chlorophyll, in the presence of light, to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen."

**Ages 3-5**:
"Trees drink water and get sunshine, and then they grow big and tall."

**Ages 6-8**:
"Plant leaves are like little factories, using sunlight, water, and air to make the food they need."

**Ages 9-12**:
"Inside plant leaves is an amazing 'factory'—chlorophyll. It can use the energy from sunlight to transform carbon dioxide from the air and water absorbed by roots into plant food (glucose) and the oxygen we breathe. This process is called photosynthesis."

### Emotional Concept Adaptation

**Original**:
"He felt deep loneliness, as if abandoned by the entire world."

**Ages 3-5**:
"Little Bear was home alone, missing mommy very much."

**Ages 6-8**:
"Little Bear sat in the room, everything was quiet. It felt lonely and really wished a friend would come play."

**Ages 9-12**:
"Little Bear sat alone in the empty room, the sounds of laughter outside making it feel even more lonely. It missed family, missed friends, feeling like it had been forgotten in a corner of the world."

### Moral Dilemma Adaptation

**Original**:
"He faced a moral dilemma: telling the truth might hurt his friend, but lying would go against his conscience."

**Ages 3-5**:
(Avoid such complex themes, change to simple right/wrong)
"Tommy accidentally broke the toy. Should he tell daddy?"

**Ages 6-8**:
"Tommy accidentally broke his friend's toy. If he tells the truth, his friend might be upset; if he doesn't say anything, Tommy will feel really uncomfortable inside. What should Tommy do?"

**Ages 9-12**:
"Tommy faced a difficult choice: being honest might hurt his friend's feelings and create a rift in their friendship; but hiding the truth, going against his conscience, would make it hard for him to sleep at night. Honesty or friendship—which is more important?"

## Common Mistakes

### ❌ Mistake 1: Over-simplification Loses Meaning

**Wrong Example** (Ages 3-5):
"Bunny walk. Hole. Light. Good."

**Correct Example**:
"Little Bunny went to play. It saw a hole. There was light in the hole. Very pretty."

### ❌ Mistake 2: Inappropriate Vocabulary Replacement

**Wrong Example**:
"canine" → "doggy" (too babyish for ages 9-12)

**Correct Example**:
"canine" → "dog" or "puppy"

### ❌ Mistake 3: Losing Core Information

**Original**:
"Little Bunny gathered courage and walked into the cave, discovering treasure."

**Wrong Example** (over-simplified):
"Little Bunny walked. Saw stuff."

**Correct Example**:
"Little Bunny was very brave. It walked into the hole. Wow! Treasure!"

### ❌ Mistake 4: Not Matching Cognitive Development

**Wrong Example** (abstract concepts for ages 3-5):
"Little Bunny understood the true meaning of friendship, grasping the dialectical relationship between giving and receiving."

**Correct Example**:
"Little Bunny learned that good friends help each other."

## Usage Suggestions

1. **Prioritize Preserving Emotion**: Even when simplifying, keep the emotional core of the story
2. **Maintain Educational Value**: Don't lose educational meaning through simplification
3. **Respect Children**: Don't be condescending, use respectful tone
4. **Test Readability**: Imagine a real child reading—can they understand?
5. **Be Flexible**: There are individual differences within the same age group, adjust appropriately

## Important Notes

- Always use positive, uplifting language
- Avoid descriptions that cause fear or anxiety
- Respect cultural diversity, avoid stereotypes
- Use gender-neutral expressions
- Protect children's imagination and curiosity
